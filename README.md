# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Final_Project
This is the final course project.
This repository has a file run_analysis.R that performs the following functions
1) Load the activity and feature info
2) Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
3) Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
4) Merges the two datasets
5) Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
6) Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
